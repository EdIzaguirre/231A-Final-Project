To Do

- Get Cd and reference area from a paper. Pick some average Cd (it usually varies by angle of attack) and justify usage.
- I will reformulate constant acceleration problem, cutting magnitude of thrust(This depends on our Cd and reference area). Should also make it more feasible.
- MPC is difficult, some people should try Xf = 0, others should tackle some sort of LQR/pole placement method, using new , more feasible xBar. Also be sure to include same noise term as in batch. (This should not go on past 4:00 PM!)
- Perhaps tuning of cost function (Q, new alpha coefficients I added) could help!
- I pushed noise to GitHub, linearization branch for Batch Approach
- PPT needs work
- Overleaf needs finishing, results and references

Timeline:

4:00 PM Finish MPC, regardless of results

5:00 - 7:00 PM: Finish Powerpoint, record audio

7:00 - 9:00 PM: Compile audio/video, finishing touches on overleaf, submit.
