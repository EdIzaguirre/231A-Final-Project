- Get Cd and reference area from a paper. Pick some average Cd (it usually varies by angle of attack) and justify usage.
- I will reformulate constant acceleration problem, bringing the order of magnitude of thrust closer to order of magnitude as max drag (10^3) (This depends on our Cd and reference area). Should also make it more feasible.
- Perhaps tuning of cost function (Q, new alpha coefficients I added) could help!
- I pushed noise to GitHub, linearization branch for Batch Approach
- PPT needs work
- Overleaf needs finishing, results and references
